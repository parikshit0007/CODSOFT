![Titanic]("C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\titanic-cruising-at-night-zbknc6f8rl1vw09e.jpg")

## Overview

This repository contains a beginner-friendly project where we build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic project is an excellent starting point for those entering the field of data science.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information about individual passengers, such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Ticket class
- Fare
- Cabin
- Survival status

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementation of a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) for predicting survival outcomes based on passenger features.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilization of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

## Files

- **titanic_prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project, from data exploration to model evaluation.

- **titanic_dataset.csv:** The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`titanic_prediction.ipynb`) in a suitable environment (e.g., Anaconda or JupyterHub).

3. Explore the analysis, model implementation, and evaluation steps.
